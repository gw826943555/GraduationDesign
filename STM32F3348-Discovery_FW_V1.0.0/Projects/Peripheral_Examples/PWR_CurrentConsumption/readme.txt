@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the STM32F33xx system to measure different
Low Power modes current consumption. The Low Power modes are:
  - Sleep Mode
  - STOP mode with RTC
  - STANDBY mode without RTC 
  - STANDBY mode with RTC

To run this example, user has to follow these steps:
 1. Select the Low power modes to be measured by uncommenting the corresponding
    line inside the stm32f33x_lp_modes.h file.
    @code
       /* #define SLEEP_MODE */
       /* #define STOP_MODE */
       /* #define STANDBY_MODE */
       #define STANDBY_RTC_MODE
    @endcode       

 2. Use an external amperemeter to measure the Idd current. 

 3. This example can not be used in DEBUG mode as the JTAG IOs are disabled to
    reduce power consumption.

@note When using the small packages (48 and 64 pin packages), the GPIO pins which 
      are not present on these packages, must not be configured in analog mode.

Here below a detailed description of the example code:

 1. After reset, the program waits for User button connected to the PA.00 to be 
    pressed to enter the selected low power mode.
     - In SLEEP_MODE, press again the User button to exit the low power mode.
     - In STOP_MODE and STANDBY_RTC_MODE, the wakeup from low power mode is automatically 
       generated by the RTC (after ~5s).
     - In STANDBY_MODE test, press again User button to exit the low power mode.
     
 2. Low power modes description:

    - Sleep Mode
    ============  
            - System Running at PLL (72MHz)
            - Flash 2 wait state
            - Prefetch enabled
            - Code running from Internal FLASH
            - All peripherals disabled.
            - Wakeup using EXTI Line 0 (PA.00, connected to User button on STM32F3348-DISCO)

    - STOP Mode
    ===========
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - Regulator in LP mode
            - HSI, HSE OFF and LSI if not used as RTC Clock source
            - No IWDG
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC clocked by LSI 

    - STANDBY Mode
    ==============
            - RTC OFF
            - IWDG and LSI OFF
            - Wakeup using WakeUp Pin1 (PA.00, connected to User button on STM32F3348-DISCO)
                        
    - STANDBY Mode with RTC clocked by LSI 
    ==========================================
            - RTC Clocked by LSI
            - IWDG OFF
            - Automatic Wakeup using RTC

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F3348-DISCO board (MB1142A) 
    and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
 - This example runs on STM32F334xx Devices.

  - STM32F3348-DISCO Set-up
    - Remove JP3 labeled Idd and connect an amperemeter to measure the STM32F33xx 
      consumption on the STM32F3348-DISCO board.    

@par How to use it?
